### Hello ðŸ‘‹

<br>

I hail from Spain and serve as an actor, concurrently holding the esteemed positions of Chief Visionary Officer, Owner, and Founder at [@GalNod](https://www.galnod.com). In tandem with my entrepreneurial pursuits, I sometimes contribute to open-source projects, with a primary focus on leveraging TypeScript and JavaScript in my programming endeavors. My coding proficiency extends across a spectrum of languages, encompassing Python, PHP, Java, Shell, Lua, CSS, and EJS, showcasing a versatility that may extend beyond the languages expressly enumerated here.
